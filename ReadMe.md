A Micro Dynamic Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm for Small-scale Smart Greenhouse with Low-power Microprocessor
======
Introduction
-------
Welcome to my GitHub homepage, where my papers and code are available. 
This is my first academic paper, focusing on the field of dynamic multi-objective optimization. After two and a half years, I went from being a research novice to being able to develop some of my own gadgets. 
The improvement this paper has brought me far exceeds the significance of the article itself.
If you have any questions about this article or related fields, please feel free to communicate with me at any time. QQ email:1972026766@qq.com. ðŸ˜‡

Environment
---
The operating environment is based on [Matlab2018b](https://www.mathworks.com/) at least. 
The platform we are using is [PlatEMO](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO). __You can directly use this to run the code.__ðŸ˜ƒ
